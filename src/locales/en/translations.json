      "reasons-2": "2) Implicit dependencies: If different dependencies have hidden or implicit dependencies on the same package, this can also cause a version conflict. If one dependency requires a specific version of a package and another dependency requires a different version of the same package, there is a problem.",

      "solution-1": "Upgrading versions: Try manually updating dependencies to their compatible versions.",
      "solution-2": "Many dependency management tools such as maven, npm, yarn, and pnpm can automatically resolve dependency conflicts.

For example, maven uses the <a href= {\"https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html\"}>nearest-wins</a> for conflict resolution.",
      "consequences-1": "Different versions of dependencies may have incompatible changes in interface, functionality, or behavior. This may result in compilation or runtime errors because code written for one version of a dependency may not work with another version. Version incompatibilities can lead to unpredictable behavior and errors in the application.",
      "consequences-2": "Code duplication: If different modules or libraries use different versions of the same dependency, this can lead to code duplication in the project. Each version of the dependency will be downloaded and used separately, which can increase the size and complexity of the project support. Code duplication can also lead to consistency and compatibility issues between modules."

      "solution-1": "It is necessary to control the modules used, check the license under which they are released and apply them according to your application. If you find a dependency with the wrong type of license, try to find similar functionality in another framework/library or follow the terms of the license." ,
